# ECE455
FreeRTOS project 

## Project Overview
This folder contains the ECE455 main project, which demonstrates real-time operating system (RTOS) concepts using FreeRTOS on embedded hardware. The code and hardware setup are designed for hands-on learning in embedded systems and digital control.

## Hardware Description
See the attached video below for hardware documentation:

Key features include:
- Multiple LEDs (green, red, yellow) for output indication and status display.
- Integrated circuits (ICs) for logic control and signal processing.
- Resistors for current limiting and signal conditioning.
- Jumper wires for connections between components and microcontroller pins.
- The circuit is likely used to demonstrate digital output control, timing, and possibly PWM or task scheduling using FreeRTOS.

## Usage
Refer to the source files and hardware schematic for details on how to build, program, and test the system. The breadboard setup provides a visual and practical demonstration of embedded control using FreeRTOS.
