In shadows deep, where secrets lie,
Encryption weaves its silent sigh.
A message cloaked in ciphered art,
Guarded well, each hidden part.

Keys unlock the veiled domain,
Decryption sings a clear refrain.
What once was masked, now shines anew,
Truth revealed for just a few.

So let the code and logic blend,
From sender’s hand to trusted friend.
In every byte, a promise kept—
A whispered secret, safely slept.
