# Local Law App - Mobile Prototype

This is a React-based mobile app prototype for "Local Law" - an educational app about local laws. The app is built using Vite + React and designed with a mobile-first approach.

## Project Structure

- Mobile-style UI with bottom tab navigation
- 4 main tabs: Home, Search, Game, Settings
- Medium fidelity prototype with no actual storage logic
- Uses React Router for navigation and Lucide React for icons

## Key Features

- Location-based law information (hardcoded locations: Saanich, Sooke, Esquimalt)
- Category filtering (Cycling, Business, Traffic)
- Search functionality with category icons
- Calendar popup for date selection
- Settings with visual-only dropdowns

## Development Guidelines

- Focus on mobile UI/UX patterns
- Use modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)
- Implement responsive design for mobile screens
- Use placeholder data for all content
- Prioritize visual fidelity over backend functionality
