# ECE 355 Project Overview

This folder contains coursework and projects for ECE 355, focusing on digital signal processing and embedded systems. The main file, `PWM project.c`, demonstrates Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) techniques, which are commonly used for controlling motors, LEDs, and other devices in embedded applications. The code showcases how to generate and manipulate PWM signals programmatically, providing a practical example for students learning about real-time digital control.

## Main File
- **PWM project.c**: Implements PWM signal generation and control logic for embedded systems.

## Usage
Open and compile `PWM project.c` using your preferred C compiler for embedded platforms. Review the code comments for details on configuration and usage.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand the principles of PWM and its applications.
- Gain hands-on experience with embedded C programming.
- Apply digital control techniques in real-world scenarios.
